            <p>Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) is a banger technology that allows instant cheap payments by Bitcoin locked in widely accepted <b>Layer 2</b>.</p>
            <p>Our endeavor is to get together all places in Prague that are accepting Lightning as a means of payment. We want to have the best up-to-date list of places, where you can enjoy coffee, beer or pay for goods or services in Prauge. We have a list of e-shops as well, since we want to support adoption of Lightning and not all people accepting Lightning are caf√©s or similar.</p>
